- ðŸ’» Full-stack software developer in web and application technologies with APIs.
- ðŸ“Š Progress and learning new things are what motivate me.
- ðŸ¦¾ I never shy away from a challenge, always ready to surpass myself !

I love discovering new things every day, the digital world is so exciting and interesting. Imagination can be endless and limitless. Every new line of code written in the world is another step towards technological innovation, whether it's relevant or not. I thrive on the knowledge the world can bring us, and the satisfaction we get when we succeed in our projects. So do as I do, don't be afraid of the unknown and dive into the great world of IT!

- [MonopolyBank](https://monopolybank.leobsst.fr): Tired of losing your monopoly tickets? This web application lets you play with your friends simply using their phones, so you don't have to use tickets for your board games.
